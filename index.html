    <h2 id="1">My Birthday</h2>
    <p class="sub">Posted on February 24th 2020, 22:00</p>
    
    <p><strong>15</strong> years into my life! Kind of sounds fascinating to me. Yes, it was my Birthday today. To be Honest, <em><strong>Best Birthday Ever</strong></em>.To start, it was a regular day and I ain't that excited for birthdays but 15 years sounded <em>big</em>. I got up early to mark exact 15 years of my existence, Did I tell you I was born at 5:45? And just so I realized my change in past 15 years or at least what I could remember till then. In the past few years, I changed as a physique and as a person; <em>more curious, enthusiastic and, of course, more motivated.</em> I spent a fair amount of time thinking about my life and some <em>deep stuff</em>.Overall, I had a great day (and night too). My tongue is soo sweet even right now, I've had <em>Cakes and Doughnuts and Smoothies</em>; I can't even count how much!! We had a grand party arranged by my Classmates and Friends, it was <strong><em>awesome</em></strong>. At home, we had a huge dinner with family. Interaction with a lot of people, if you ask me; never had this much attention (even though I love my privacy and solitude more).For a person who is <em>not</em> a fan of Birthdays, well, this birthday was a <strong>blast</strong> for me. I had a lot of time <em>alone</em>, which I <em>*absolutely*</em> loved, but aside from that my best friends and my family made it <strong><em>even better!</em></strong></p>

    <h2 id="2">Voice Unheard</h2>
    <p class="sub">Posted on July 18th 2020, 22:00</p>
    
    <p>I always had this idea in the back of my mind; that I would be able to share my idea to the <em>world</em>. I would be <em>heard</em> and be <em>noticed</em>. Well, this could obviously be a result of the fact that I am neglected a lot, but that's not a point. The point is that I let <strong>my voice</strong> out, out there in the real world.</p>
    
    <p>So... I decided to start my new Blog (on <em>Blogspot</em>). And it's named <strong><em>Voice Unheard</em></strong> dedicated to mine that's yearning to be heard. I've not maintained it properly <em>yet</em>. But soon, I think I will get a hold of it. <em>*wink*</em></p>
    
    <p>There must be something that you <em>fear</em>, everyone has something. Mine is being <strong><em>invisible</em></strong>, going <em>unheard</em>. This blog is totally dedicated to me finding my <em>lost voice</em>, accepting my thoughts as my own and not throwing them away.</p>
