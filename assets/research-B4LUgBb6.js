Pioneered the use of Explainable AI (XAI) in Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis to transform Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis into a transparent and trustworthy process.

Identified a critical neurophysiological biomarker for PTSD: Beta Power Spectral Density in the Right Primary Motor Cortex, linking the disorder directly to heightened arousal and sensory impairments.

Conducted a thorough Fairness Analysis on the diagnostic framework, exposing significant demographic biases across groups (sex, education) and establishing a necessity for equitable AI in psychiatric healthcare.

## Contributions
- Applied XAI techniques to EEG features to produce human-interpretable explanations.
- Discovered Beta PSD in the Right Primary Motor Cortex as a discriminative biomarker for PTSD.
- Performed fairness audits across demographic groups and proposed mitigation strategies to reduce bias.
