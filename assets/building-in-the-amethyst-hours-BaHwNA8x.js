There's something magical about coding when the world sleeps. The amethyst hours—those twilight moments between midnight and dawn—hold a special place in my creative process.

## The Midnight Muse

In the stillness of night, distractions fade. The mind becomes a clearer canvas for complex ideas. Algorithms that seemed impossible during the day suddenly unfold like origami.

## Creative Flow

Late-night sessions aren't about productivity metrics. They're about diving deep into problems, exploring dead ends, and emerging with insights that daylight would have obscured.

The amethyst hours teach patience. They remind us that great work isn't rushed—it's nurtured in the quiet spaces between thoughts.

## Finding Balance

While these hours fuel creativity, they also demand balance. The body and mind need rest to sustain the spark of innovation.

Yet, in those violet moments, I find the truest expression of my craft.`;export{e as default};
