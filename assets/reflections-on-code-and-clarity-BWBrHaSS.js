In the quiet hours of debugging, I often find myself reflecting on the elegance of simplicity. Clean code isn't just about readability—it's about creating systems that whisper their intentions rather than shout them.

## The Art of Simplicity

Simplicity in code is like a well-crafted poem: every line serves a purpose, every abstraction reveals deeper truth. When we strip away the unnecessary, we're left with the essence of the problem.

## Complexity as a Choice

Sometimes complexity is necessary, but it should always be intentional. Each layer of abstraction should solve a real problem, not create new ones.

The challenge lies in knowing when to embrace complexity and when to reject it. Experience teaches us that the simplest solution is often the hardest to find, but always worth the search.`;export{e as default};
