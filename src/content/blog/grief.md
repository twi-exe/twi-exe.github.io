**Grief.** The birthplace of all art. That’s what it is, or at least my perception of it. The way we process it is the core identity of what makes us who we are. The grief is never-ending. It is what gives life meaning. It is the opposite of happiness, the yin of the yan. It complements the good and makes up life. It balances out, which is actually what life is. So, grief, like happiness, is persistent. However, grief gives birth to unusual practices. Which is why Stoicism thinks of it as an irrational response.

**Denial.** The stage of shock and pure disbelief rose upon the knowledge of an unimaginable occurrence. Undoubtedly, it is a natural response to cling on to something lost; to still keep hoping the damage would be undone. Denial leads you to hope, and the belief that probably there’s still something that could be done to stop the inevitable. 

**Anger.** Of not being able to do anything. The hope fades away, the reality settles in and it’s evident that the inevitable has happened, And there’s nothing that we could have done or can do to undo or prevent it. That’s when anger comes into the picture, yet another natural response that is targeted as opposed to denial.

**Bargaining.** Trying to fix it. While anger is what one feels towards the inevitable, bargaining is what one does to change it. One might try to negotiate in forms to avoid or mitigate the loss. This may involve making promises or seeking ways to regain what has been lost.

**Depression.** Often analogous to grief itself, this is the primary stage of grief. This results in the feeling of confusion and emptiness. Not being able to think straight, and clouded thoughts are quite common. This is mourning, true grief of the loss.

**Acceptance.** Coming to terms with the reality of the loss. As the final stage of grief, one learns how to live with it, With the consequences of this loss; the same they were once angry for. This completes the circle of grief, where one shall live with this loss for the rest of their lives.
