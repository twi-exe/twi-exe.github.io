## The Paradox of Loss

So, right yes. **Loss.**
I have indeed got nothing to lose. And it’s not cinematic because it’s true.

I mean, I do have everything: my life, my career, my passion, my love—
everything I have built since the day I was born from my mother’s womb.
Again, I do have *a lot* of things—
the debts, the people, the emotions they bring along.
But in the truest manner, **I have nothing to lose.**

When I lose something, I gain an innate sense of the world’s way of working,
the god’s way of thinking, and a huge wave of emotions.
I am constantly just **one loss away** from moving towards an immensely emotionally rich life.

* One loss away from becoming stoic.
* One loss away from finding the true meaning of life.
* One loss away from realizing the one constant truth neither you nor I can change.

You will keep losing things—
everything you own, everything you’ve built from the ground up.

The universe is a constant ticking bomb waiting to reset any moment,
and yours can be taken away in a span of a second.

Even when I haven’t lost anything,
I still have nothing to lose.
I have everything that keeps me happy,
and yet I have nothing to lose.

Because every loss is inevitable,
and in every loss I see a blurry silver lining.

Tragedies are born from loss, and people love tragedies.
Art is born from loss, and art is all we want to see—
all the time, everywhere.

We are hardwired to find beauty;
and **loss is beauty.**

It is cruel and gruesome and evil—
it wrenches your heart out, undoes everything you’ve built,
every moment of joy or pride you’ve had—
and yet, it does so **gracefully.**

A tragic hero smiles at the audience knowing he has lost everything,
asking,

> “What more do I have to lose?”

And then, he sacrifices his life.

Irony, isn’t it?  

For starters, he *did* have something to lose—his life.  
And many will agree: **life is everything.**. 

Because you, my fellow observer, are here *because* of life.  
For you at least, your life *is* everything.  
Now obviously, you have everything to lose if you are alive.   

How contradictory.   
How paradoxical.  
Or maybe… purely dumb?  

But here’s another perspective— _tragic war heroes are always celebrated_.

I also believe **legacies** are the next best thing after life itself.

Imagine: living a life, building a bird’s nest,  
just to watch it taken away by a storm—  
and to see it from a stranger’s point of view,   
because you’re technically supposed to be dead.   

But no, they’re building a **memorial** out of it.  
They’re ensuring bird nests are safe,  
so that others may survive.  

How convenient, you think,  
*if only someone else had that legacy before you.*. 

But here’s another truth: you are going to die. You will keep losing things— everything you own, everything you’ve built from the ground up. And you are going to lose this life.

So, you might as well secure the second best thing you own—
**your legacy.** Aha! So you do have something to lose after all.
Your legacy.

Well, yeah—but at what cost?
Your life?

Your life is everything. If you’re willing to give that up for your legacy—
then surely, you have nothing to lose.

You might have everything.
You might have the security of everything.
But you should have **nothing to lose.**

That is the fact.
Now listen carefully:

> You have everything to lose, and yet nothing to lose.  
> You have to fight because you have everything to lose,   
> even when you have nothing to lose.   
> But you also have to sit back and think you have nothing to lose.  
> when you indeed have everything to lose.   

Because that will give you the strength, to truly fight the fight worth making.

You aren’t meant to be in boxes.  
Grow out.  
Jump about.  

You are **a fluid**—
run away, explore, fight.

You aren’t supposed to shape yourself.
You are supposed to **fit in when you have to.**

*Loss is inevitable.
Legacy is optional.
But courage—courage is the choice you make when you realise you have nothing left to lose.*
