Developed and deployed the core ML and data pipeline, standardizing clinical entities from raw documents and feeding the information into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for risk prediction at scale.

Contributed to the full product lifecycle, from high-fidelity data extraction (OCR/NER) to engineering the risk modeling and recommendation service powered by large language models (MedLM).

### Highlights
- Standardized clinical entity extraction from heterogeneous medical documents (OCR + NER).
- Built a scalable pipeline that materializes structured clinical graphs for downstream modeling.
- Trained and deployed a GNN-based risk prediction model for population-level risk scoring.
- Engineered a MedLM-backed recommendation service for actionable clinical insights.
