    "content": "# Enhancing Fairness and Interpretability in EEG-Based PTSD Diagnosis with XAI\n\nPioneered the use of Explainable AI (XAI) in Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis to transform Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis into a transparent and trustworthy process.\n\nIdentified a critical neurophysiological biomarker for PTSD: Beta Power Spectral Density in the Right Primary Motor Cortex, linking the disorder directly to heightened arousal and sensory impairments.\n\nConducted a thorough Fairness Analysis on the diagnostic framework, exposing significant demographic biases across groups (sex, education) and establishing a necessity for equitable AI in psychiatric healthcare.\n\n## Contributions\n- Applied XAI techniques to EEG features to produce human-interpretable explanations.\n- Discovered Beta PSD in the Right Primary Motor Cortex as a discriminative biomarker for PTSD.\n- Performed fairness audits across demographic groups and proposed mitigation strategies to reduce bias.\n"
